+# Spiritual Life
+
+Nurturing your spiritual life and growing in the life of faith are two of the most important things that you will do during your time at Trevecca. It is our prayer that by participating in worship, discipleship groups and ministry opportunities locally and globally, God will be at work, transforming us individually and as a community.
+
+## Chapel
+
+Believing that worship is central to the Christian life, members of the Trevecca community gather together each week for corporate worship. Chapel services take place on most Monday evenings at 6pm and Tuesday and Thursday mornings at 9:30am. All chapel services (unless otherwise noted in iAttended app) will be held in Boone Convocation Center with video overflow space in Benson Auditorium. Members of our Graduate and Adult Education community and Alumni can join us online for chapels on the Trevecca Chapel Youtube channel.
+
+- There are other special chapel gatherings or events throughout the semester that count towards chapel credit. Please see your iAttended app for details.
+
+Please plan to attend chapel for your required credits unless you receive an email confirmation of a chapel exemption.
+
+## FAQs
+
+### Q: What is the Chapel Attendance Policy?
+
+A: All full-time Trevecca undergraduate students (12 hours or more) must attend required chapels throughout the semester. Your chapel credit assignment is based on the number of academic credit hours completed at the beginning of each semester. The requirements for chapel attendance are as follows:
+
+- Freshmen/Sophomores (0-59 credit hours complete) - 24 Chapel Credits Required
+- Juniors/Seniors (60+ credit hours complete) - 20 Chapel Credits Required
+
+All part-time students (6 - 11 hours) must attend 12 chapels during the semester.
+
+### Q: How do I set up iAttended?
+
+Attendance is taken through the iAttended app (available on Google Play or App Store).
+
+The iAttended app is your go-to for checking the chapel schedule, locations, and service opportunities. It’s also how you’ll scan in and out for credit and track your attendance. If you're having trouble with the app, here's a handy user guide!
+
+- Download the app from the Apple App or Google Play stores before the first chapel.
+- Log in using Microsoft Single Sign-On with your TNU email.
+- New students: enter the code XGAG to access the schedule.
+
+Please bring your phone to chapel to check in and out—but we encourage you to put it on airplane mode during chapel to be fully present.
+
+### Q: How do I earn credit?
+
+A: When you arrive at chapel, you'll click "scan QR" in your iAttended app and scan the QR on one of the iPads in the lobby. At the end of chapel, we'll show a code you can enter in your iAttended app to complete your credit. To earn credit, you must be present for the entire chapel service and have both an entrance scan and an exit code. You are responsible for ensuring you receive credit. If you experience technical difficulties, please see Regan Smith or one of our chapel ushers in person during chapel. We cannot offer credit via email after chapel events have ended.
+
+### Q: What if I have trouble with my phone/app during chapel, or experience trouble getting credit while I'm there?
+
+A: We have ushers there to help you in person at chapel to be sure you receive your credit. If you experience trouble with your phone (broken camera, power failure, etc…), receive an error message in the iAttended app, or have any other trouble at chapel getting your credit counted in iAttended, please be sure to see an usher before you leave. Credit will not be granted following the chapel event.
+
+### Q: When is Spiritual Deepening Week?
+
+A: Spiritual Deepening Week for the spring '26 semester is January 26-29th with services beginning Monday evening at 6pm and ending Thursday morning after the 9:30am service. Our guest speaker for this semester is Grant Miller, new pastor of Nashville First Church of the Nazarene and former University Chaplain at Northwest Nazarene University.
+
+### Q: I'm a commuter without a class or lab before 12pm on Tuesdays AND Thursdays. Do I get a reduction in chapel requirements?
+
+A: Commuting students with no classes or labs before 12pm on Tuesday/Thursday will automatically have their chapel requirements reduced to 12 (this change will be reflected in iAttended sometime after the last day to drop/add classes - likely around the second or third week of September).
+
+### Q: I am a Junior/Senior (or a commuter with no classes or labs before 12pm on T/Th). Why is my app showing I still need 24 credits?
+
+A: Our attendance team is not able to update iAttended with the tiered requirements and the commuter/class reductions until after the last day to drop/add classes. The correct information should be reflected in your app sometime soon after the third week of classes. If you find a discrepancy later in the semester, please e-mail chapel@trevecca.edu and we will be glad to make the correction.
+
+### Q: What about Service Opportunities for credit?
+
+A: Selected service opportunities are available for chapel credit! Service opportunities can count towards a maximum of 2 of the total number of required chapel credits in a semester. Details are listed in iAttended. You can sign up for the opportunities in your iAttended app!
+
+### Q: What about chapel exemptions?
+
+A: Due to the centrality of the chapel experience at Trevecca, exemptions for chapel attendance are rare. However, we recognize there will be some extenuating circumstances that may need accommodation.
+
+Exemption requests may be submitted in the first two weeks of each semester only. The link to the exemption form will be available at the start of each semester in the "Helpful Links" section of this site. Students who think they may qualify for a chapel exemption need to apply during that time frame. Please note: while we recognize that all college students likely need to work during the week, we cannot grant chapel exemptions on this basis.
+
+### Q: What happens if I don't meet the required chapel credits in a given semester?
+
+A: Failure to meet the required number of chapels will result in a series of chapel fines and potentially chapel probation. You can read about the fine schedule and details regarding chapel probation in the Student Handbook.
+
+### Q: I'm a non-traditional adult student or in one of the TNU graduate programs. What is there for me?
+
+A: While there are no requirements for chapel participation for non-traditional or graduate students, we do want to help shepherd your journey in spiritual life. You can join us online (or in-person if you're in the area) for our chapel services anytime you'd like! Additionally, each week you'll receive a Weekly Devotional from our University Chaplain, Erik Gernand or our Associate Provost for Mission Excellence & Reconciliation, Dr. Terrence Schofield, who also assists in pastoral care of our non-trad/graduate students. In these e-mails, you'll find a Prayer Request link where you can submit requests to our prayer team and ask for additional pastoral support whenever you need it! We love hearing from you!
