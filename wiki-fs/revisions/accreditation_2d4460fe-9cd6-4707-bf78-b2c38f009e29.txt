+The School of Education at Trevecca Nazarene University is accredited by the Council for the Accreditation of Educator Preparation (CAEP) following a very successful 2022 visit. This continued accreditation is at the initial teacher preparation and advanced preparation levels, and signifies that the education preparation provider (EPP) and its programs meet rigorous standards set forth by the professional education community. The program was initially accredited by the National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education (NCATE)in 2009 and reaffirmed by NCATE in 2016. The teaching majors offered in collaboration with other University departments are approved by the Tennessee State Board of Education and are part of the CAEP accreditation. The next CAEP accreditation visit is scheduled for Fall 2029.

+At its March 2025 meeting, the Accreditation Review Commission on Education for the Physician Assistant, Inc. (ARC-PA) extended Accreditation-Probation status for the Trevecca Nazarene University Physician Assistant Program sponsored by Trevecca Nazarene University until its next review in March 2027. Probation accreditation is a temporary accreditation status initially of not less than two years. However, that period may be extended by the ARC-PA for up to an additional two years if the ARC-PA finds that the program is making substantial progress toward meeting all applicable standards but requires additional time to come into full compliance. Probation accreditation status is granted, at the sole discretion of the ARC-PA, when a program holding an accreditation status of Accreditation - Provisional or Accreditation - Continued does not, in the judgment of the ARC-PA, meet the Standards or when the capability of the program to provide an acceptable educational experience for its students is threatened. Once placed on probation, a program that fails to comply with accreditation requirements in a timely manner, as specified by the ARC-PA, may be scheduled for a focused site visit and is subject to having its accreditation withdrawn. Specific questions regarding the Program and its plans should be directed to the Program Director and/or the appropriate institutional official(s). The program’s accreditation history can be viewed on the ARC-PA website at: [www.arc-pa.org/accreditation-history-trevecca-nazarene-university/](https://www.arc-pa.org/accreditation-history-trevecca-nazarene-university/).
