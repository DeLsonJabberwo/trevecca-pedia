# Nazarene Beliefs

Trevecca Nazarene University is the officially recognized institution of higher education for the Southeastern Region of the Church of the Nazarene.

Founded in 1901 as an independent ministerial training school, Trevecca became a Nazarene institution in 1915. It is one of eight regional universities of the Church located in the continental United States.

The [Church of the Nazarene](https://nazarene.org/) is the largest of a group of denominations that originated in the late 19th and early 20th centuries out of a deeper-life nationwide revival that emphasized the Methodist teaching of sanctification. This tradition was rooted in the work and teachings of John and Charles Wesley, early members of the Church of England and the founders of Methodism.

The Church of the Nazarene is located in the mainstream of the Christian faith, subscribing to the central orthodox teachings embodied in the creeds of the early Christians. Its theology affirms the saving work of Christ for all and human freedom to respond to the grace of God as well as the power to live a holy life. From its beginning, the Church of the Nazarene has been committed to quality education, personal piety, and social justice—a commitment reflected in the mission and practices of Trevecca.
