### Overview
Trevecca University’s Theatre Department opened its fall season with the high‑energy, dance‑heavy musical *Newsies*, a Disney adaptation of the 1899 New York City newsboys’ strike. The production debuted on October 31 and ran through November 9 in Benson Auditorium, drawing on nearly two dozen student performers.

### Creative Vision
Director Jeff Frame chose *Newsies* to showcase the department’s growing capacity for large‑scale, choreography‑intensive shows. Twining highlighted the musical’s enduring relevance—“the message that young people can change the world” remains as potent today as it was in 1899. The staging features an expansive multi‑level set and blends ballet, tap, and acrobatics to convey the story’s energy and rebellion.

### Production Highlights
* **Choreography** – described by Twining as “the danciest show Trevecca has ever done,” demanding both technical skill and emotional intensity from the cast.  
* **Message** – the production emphasizes collective action, hope amid adversity, and the power of youth advocacy—mirroring the university’s own cultural conversations.  

### Reception
While no formal reviews were cited in the original announcement, the production was promoted as a milestone for Trevecca Theatre, illustrating the department’s evolution from a campus where dancing had once been prohibited to a fully equipped performing‑arts hub.
