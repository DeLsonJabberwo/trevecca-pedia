# Search Service

## Prefix

All routes to the API Layer begin with a version and the service.  
<br>
So, calls to the `search` service begin with: `/v1/search`

## Service Architecture

The search service uses [Bleve](https://blevesearch.com/) as its full-text search engine. It maintains a local index that is populated by fetching data from the wiki service.

### Data Flow
1. The search service fetches pages from the wiki service's `/indexable-pages` endpoint
2. Pages are indexed with their slug as the document ID
3. Search queries are executed against the local Bleve index
4. Results return matching page slugs

### Indexed Fields
- `slug`: keyword-analyzed field (exact match, boost 2.0)
- `name`: text field with English analyzer (boost 5.0)
- `content`: text field with English analyzer (boost 1.0)
- `last_modified`: datetime field
- `archive_date`: datetime field

### Startup Behavior
On startup, the service automatically attempts to perform a full index if the index doesn't exist or is empty.

---

## Configuration

The search service requires the following configuration:

- `INDEX_DIR`: Path to the directory where the search index is stored
- `WIKI_URL`: Base URL of the wiki service (e.g., `http://wiki:8080/v1/wiki`) for fetching indexable pages

See `.env.example` for all configuration options.
