# TreveccaPedia (trevecca-pedia)

TreveccaPedia is a centralized wiki-based information repository for all things Trevecca Nazarene University.

The goal is to provide a unified and common platform for the publishing, sharing, and accessing of information, to serve an ever-growing need in the Trevecca community.

# Usage/Development

Be sure to install the necessary tools from the [Common Tools](#common-tools) section.

If you want to change or develop certain parts of the project, you'll need tools that are described in the [Developer Tools](#developer-tools) section.

Each service is located in its own directory.

Inside each service directory is a `README.md` for info on deploying and using that service.

- [Web Server](./web/README.md)
- [API Layer](./api-layer/README.md)
- [Wiki](./wiki/README.md)
- [Wiki Database](./wiki-db/README.md)
- [Wiki Filesystem](./wiki-fs/README.md)
- [Search] (./search/README.md)

## Common Tools

You will have to install these in order to run the services.

For Windows, I recommend using [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) and installing the Linux versions.
Otherwise, Linux is the preferred environment, and MacOS should work as well.
